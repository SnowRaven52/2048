# 2048

2048 is a game created by Gabriele Cirulli where the object is to obtain the highest possible tile.

In the game, you have 4 options, to go right/left/down/up. In my code, you click the keyboard-arrow-keys to make these moves. In a move, all the tiles will shift in that direction, and if two tiles of the same number collide, they will merge to create a tile with twice the value of the merged tiles.

The goal of the game is to get to the tile 2048.

Another aspect of the game is your score. Every time two tiles merge, your score is increased by the value of the merged tile. For example, if 2 and 2 are merged to make 4, your score will be increased by 4.
